# Bike Sharing Statistical Analysis

This repository contains a statistical analysis project conducted on the **Bike Sharing dataset**.  
It combines **Python code**, **data visualizations**, and a **written report** to demonstrate how 
statistical methods can be applied to real-world datasets.

## 📊 Analysis Steps
- **Descriptive Statistics**: summary statistics of numeric variables  
- **Correlation Analysis**: relationships between variables  
- **Data Visualization**: scatter plots, swarm plots, pairplots  
- **Sampling Methods**: random sampling, Central Limit Theorem demonstration  
- **Hypothesis Testing**:  
  - z-test  
  - t-tests (one-sample, independent, paired)  
  - Wilcoxon tests for non-normal data

Some figures generated in the analysis are stored in the `figures/` folder.  
For example:  

- Correlation matrix heatmap  
- Scatter plot (wind speed vs. humidity)  
- Swarm plot (temperature vs. weekday)  
- Pairplots of multiple variables
